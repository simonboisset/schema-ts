## New validest release

For this release I added more schemas for basic typescript validation. You still can write you own schema for complex validation.

Typescript enhancement for better type validation with node react and remix.

## New schemas

Here is a list of new schema.

### And

```ts
const data = {
  age: 25,
  firstname: 'John',
  lastname: 'Doe',
};

const schema = and([
  object({
    age: int(),
  }),
  object({
    firstname: string(),
    lastname: string(),
  }),
]);

const typedData: {
  age: number;
} & {
  firstname: string;
  lastname: string;
} = validate(data, schema);
```

### Or

```ts
const data = 1;
const schema = or([string(), int()]);
const typedData: number | undefined = validate(data, schema);
```

### Object and Array

`Object` and `Array` were in core package before. I extract them and publish their own packages.
`Core` has only validation methods and Types.

## Migrate to turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) is a monorepo library with high-performance.
I update CI with it and Github actions. Despite of number of library increase, CI stays under two minutes for publishing all packages ðŸš€
